### Sections

#### Intro

This section contains the image and a few introductory messages. It also contains a direct link to the projects section.

#### Skills

This section includes a list of skills. A list of skills is directly mapped while rendering - so it will be easier to add future skills by just adding it to the constants file. Also each skill is mapped to a rating and an image. Based on the rating, the image will be clipped. The stars also depend on this rating attribute.

**A few characteristics are also mentioned on top of this section - which are also mapped from a constant but most probably will not need updation over time.**

#### Projects

This section contains a list of my personal projects. They are mapped from a constants file as well. Each project contains a link to either the application or a demo video of the same. It also contains a list of skills used in the project and a small description of what the application's purpose.

#### About

This section includes a brief history of my life highlighting some important phases or achievements.

#### Contact

This section contains various way to connect with me. There are links to my `linkedin`, `github` and `twitter` handles. My contact number and email id are also mentioned. There is also a download link to my `Resume` for recruiters.
